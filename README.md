# 🔢 Handwritten Digit Recognition - GUI Project

A digit recognition system that allows users to **draw a digit** on a canvas and have it predicted in real-time using a **trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✏️ Draw digits using your mouse
- 🧠 Recognizes digits from 0 to 9 using a trained deep learning model
- 💡 Live prediction with confidence
- 🎨 User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter (no web required)
- ⚡ Lightweight and runs locally on your machine
- 💾 Pretrained model used via `.h5` file

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10**
- **TensorFlow** – Deep learning model training and prediction
- **Tkinter** – GUI interface
- **NumPy** – Image array preprocessing
- **Pillow (PIL)** – Image drawing and resizing
